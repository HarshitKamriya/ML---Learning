# 📘 My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my ML learning repository!  
This repo documents everything I’ve learned while exploring different machine learning algorithms and building end-to-end projects.  
It’s both a personal learning log and a resource for peers who want clear, example-driven explanations.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
- To turn every ML concept into a hands-on project.
- To build a strong foundation in algorithms and practical applications.
- To share knowledge with peers in a simple, demo-friendly way.
